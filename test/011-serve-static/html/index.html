    <p>Pipy is a tiny, high performance, highly stable, programmable proxy. Written in C++, built on top of Asio asynchronous I/O library, Pipy is extremely lightweight and fast, making it one of the best choices for service mesh sidecars.</p>
    <p>With builtin JavaScript support, thanks to QuickJS, Pipy is highly customizable and also predictable in performance with no garbage collection overhead seen in other scriptable counterparts.</p>
    <p>At its core, Pipy has a modular design with many small reusable modules that can be chained together to make a pipeline, through which network data flow and get processed on the way. The way Pipy is designed makes it versatile enough for not only sidecars but also other use cases involving intermediate message processing between network nodes.</p>
