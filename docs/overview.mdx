**Pipy** is an open-source, lightweight, high-performance, modular, programmable, cloud-native network stream processor that is ideal for a variety of use-cases ranging from (but not limited to) edge routers, load balancers & proxy solutions, API gateways, static HTTP servers, service mesh sidecars, and other applications. 

As it turns out, each of those words has a pretty specific meaning of its own, so letâ€™s take a look.

### Lightweight
The compiled pipy executable is approximately 6MB in size and requires a very small memory footprint to run.

### High-performance
Pipy is written in C++ and built on top of the **Asio** asynchronous I/O library.

### Modular
Pipy has a modular design at its core, with many small reusable modules (**filters**) that can be linked together to form a pipeline through which network data flows and is processed.

### Stream processor
Pipy operates on network streams in an event-driven fashion where it consumes the input stream, performs user-provided transformations, and outputs stream. Pipy stream abstracts out data bytes into events. Refer to [Concepts](concepts) for more details.

### Programmable
Pipy comes with built-in **JavaScript** support via its custom-developed component **PipyJS** (part of the Pipy code base), making it highly customizable and predictable in performance, with no garbage collection overhead as seen in its other scriptable counterparts. Refer to [Concepts](concepts) for more details.

## Compatibility

Pipy is designed for high compatibility across different operating systems and CPU architectures. Pipy has been fully tested on these platforms:

* CentOS 7
* Ubuntu 18/20
* FreeBSD 12/13
* macOS Intel & Apple silicons

CentOS7/REHL7 or FreeBSD are recommended in production environments.
