**Pipy** is a programmable network proxy for the cloud, edge and IoT.

Written in C++, Pipy is extremely lightweight and fast. It's also programmable by using PipyJS, a tailored version of the standard JavaScript language.

## Why Pipy?

### Versatile

Although Pipy is mostly used as a high-performance reverse proxy, the true power of Pipy relies on providing you a range of pluggable building blocks, aka. filters, without imposing any restrictions on how you combine them. It's entirely up to you as to how you want to use Pipy. We've seen people using Pipy as a protocol converter, traffic recorder, message signer/verifier, serverless function starter, health checker and more.

### Fast

Pipy is written in C++. It leverages asynchronous networking. Allocated resources are pooled and reused. Data is transferred internally by pointers whenever possible, minimizing the pressure on memory bandwidth. It's fast in every way.

### Tiny

A build of Pipy in worker mode gives you an executable merely around 10MB with zero external dependencies. You'll experience the fastest download and startup times with Pipy.

### Programmable

At the core, Pipy is a script engine running PipyJS, a tailored version of ECMA standard JavaScript. By speaking the planet's most widely used programming language, Pipy gives you unparalleled expressiveness over what you have in YAML or the like.

### Open

Pipy is more open than open source. It doesn’t try to hide every detail in the black box, so you always know what you are doing. But never fear. It doesn’t require a rocket scientist to figure out how the different parts work together. In fact, you’ll have more fun as you have full control over everything.
