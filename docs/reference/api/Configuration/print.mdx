api: Configuration.print()

## Description

Appends a **print** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **print** filter outputs all [Data](/reference/api/Data) in the input stream to the standard output. Its input and output can be any kinds of events.

<FilterDiagram
  name="print"
  input="Event"
  output="Event"
/>

This filter is different from [dump()](/reference/api/Configuration/dump) in that:

- It only prints out _Data_ events
- It dumps out _Data_ object without formatting, so if the _Data_ is not text, it could mess up your terminal

This filter passes everything down unaltered. It doesn't change anything in the event stream.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .print()
```

### Return value

<ReturnValue/>
