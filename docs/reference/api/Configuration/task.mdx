# Description

Creates a pipeline layout that executes a periodic job.

The pipeline defined with this method will receive a _MessageStart/MessageEnd_ event pair regularly. The interval between two recurrences is specified as a string in its argument, with one of the time unit suffixes: `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days. If an interval is not given, the job will be done only once at startup.

Once started, the pipeline should eventually output a _StreamEnd_ event to indicate the completion of the job. The next recurrence of the job will not happen until the current one is finished.

After calling this method on a _Configuration_, the newly created pipeline layout would become current. Any _filter-creating_ methods called after this point would append filters to that pipeline, until another _pipeline-creating_ method is called.
