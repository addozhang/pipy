## Description

Appends a **demux** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **demux** filter **de-multiplexes** [Messages](/reference/api/Message) from its input stream, distribute them to many sub-pipelines and multiplexes their output _Messages_ into a single output _Message_ stream. Its input and output are _Messages_. Its sub-pipelines's input and output are also _Messages_.

<FilterDiagram
  name="demux"
  input="Message"
  output="Message"
  subInput="Message"
  subType="demux"
/>

A **demux** filter works like this:

- At the input to a **demux** filter, _Messages_ are separated
- For each input _Message_, a dedicated sub-pipeline is created, whose input will be that _Message_
- At the output from the **demux** filter, output _Messages_ coming out of all sub-pipelines are combined in the same order as they come out of their sub-pipelines (compare to [demuxQueue()](/reference/api/Configuration/demuxQueue))

One **demux** filter can have more than one sub-pipelines, each of which handles one _Message_.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .demux(layout)
```
