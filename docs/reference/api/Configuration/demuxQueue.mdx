## Description

Appends a **demuxQueue** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **demuxQueue** filter **de-multiplexes** [Messages](/reference/api/Message) from its input stream, distribute them to many sub-pipelines and multiplexes their output _Messages_ into a single _Message_ stream where the _Messages_ come in the same order as the input. Its input and output are _Messages_. Its sub-pipelines's input and output are also _Messages_.

|          |             |              |             |                |
|---------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
|          | **Message** |              | **Message** |                |
| _Input_  | →           |              | →           |                |
|          |             | `demuxQueue` |             | `sub-pipeline` |
| _Output_ | ←           |              | ←           |                |
|          | **Message** |              | **Message** |                |

A **demuxQueue** filter works like this:

- At the input to a **demuxQueue** filter, _Messages_ are separated and queued up
- For each input _Message_, a dedicated sub-pipeline is created, whose input will be that _Message_
- At the output from the **demuxQueue** filter, output _Messages_ coming out of all sub-pipelines are queued and sent out in the same order as the input _Messages_ (compare to [demux()](/reference/api/Configuration/demux))

One **demuxQueue** filter can have more than one sub-pipelines, each of which handles one _Message_.

|                 |    |              |    |                   |
|----------------:|:--:|:------------:|:--:|:------------------|
|                 |    |              | ←→ | `sub-pipeline #1` |
| `main pipeline` | ←→ | `demuxQueue` | ←→ | `sub-pipeline #2` |
|                 |    |              | ←→ | `sub-pipeline #N` |

Compare this to [muxQueue()](/reference/api/Configuration/muxQueue).
