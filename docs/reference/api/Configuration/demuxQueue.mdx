## Description

<Summary/>

<FilterDiagram
  name="demuxQueue"
  input="Message"
  output="Message"
  subInput="Message"
  subOutput="Message"
  subType="demux"
/>

A _demuxQueue_ filter does the following:

- At the input to a _demuxQueue_ filter, _Messages_ are separated and queued up
- For each input _Message_, a dedicated sub-pipeline is created, whose input is only that _Message_
- At the output from the _demuxQueue_ filter, output _Messages_ coming out from all sub-pipelines are queued and spit out in the same order as in the input (compare to [demux()](/reference/api/Configuration/demux))

One _demuxQueue_ filter can have more than one sub-pipelines, each of which handles one _Message_. Compare this to [muxQueue()](/reference/api/Configuration/muxQueue).

## Syntax
