## Description

Appends a **wait** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **wait** filter blocks all input events up until a condition is met. Its input and output can be any types of events.

|          |           |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| _Input_  |           |
| ↓        | **Event** |
| `wait`   |           |
| ↓        | **Event** |
| _Output_ |           |

The condition to wait is given by the _condition_ parameter. It should be a function that returns a truthy value when the condition is met. The function will be called every time a relevant asynchronous event happens, such as having received a response from the upstream, etc.

This filter passes everything down unaltered. It doesn't change anything in the event stream. It only delays them.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .wait(
      () => shouldContinue()
    )
```
