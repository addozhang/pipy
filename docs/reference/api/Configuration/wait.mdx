## Description

Appends a **wait** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **wait** filter blocks all input events up until a condition is met. Its input and output can be any types of events.

<FilterDiagram
  name="wait"
  input="Event"
  output="Event"
/>

The condition to wait is given by the _condition_ parameter. It should be a function that returns a truthy value when the condition is met. The function will be called every time a relevant asynchronous event happens, such as having received a response from the upstream, etc.

You can optionally set the maximum waiting time with _timeout_ option in the _options_ parameter. It can be a number in seconds or a string ending with one of the time unit suffixes including `s`, `m`, `h` and `d`.

This filter passes everything down unaltered. It doesn't change anything in the event stream. It only delays them.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .wait(
      () => shouldContinue()
    )

pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .wait(
      () => shouldContinue(),
      {
        timeout,
      }
    )
```
