api: Configuration.throttleDataRate()

## Description

Appends a **throttleDataRate** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **throttleDataRate** filter sets a limit to how many bytes of [Data](/reference/api/Data) can pass in every second. Its input and output can be any types of events, but the limit only takes effect when they have _Data_ events.

|                    |           |
|:------------------:|:---------:|
| _Input_            |           |
| ↓                  | **Event** |
| `throttleDataRate` |           |
| ↓                  | **Event** |
| _Output_           |           |

The rate limit is set by the _quota_ parameter. It can be a number in bytes, or a string with a size unit suffix such as `'k'`, `'m'`, `'g'` or `'t'`. It can also be a function that returns that value. When the limit is reached in a second, all events afterwards will be blocked until quota is recovered the next second. When the limit is zero or less, no limit is set.

Quota can be counted per account by giving an account ID in the _account_ parameter. It can be a value of any type, or a function that returns a dynamic value.

This filter passes down everything unaltered. It doesn't change anything in the event stream. It only delays them.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .throttleDataRate(quota)

pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .throttleDataRate(quota, account)
