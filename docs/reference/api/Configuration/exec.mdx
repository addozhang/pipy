## Description

Appends an **exec** filter to the current pipeline layout.

An **exec** filter starts an external process, feeds the input [Data](/reference/api/Data) to the process's standard input and outputs the _Data_ coming out of the process's standard output. Its input and output are both _Data_ events.

<FilterDiagram
  name="exec"
  input="Data"
  output="Data"
/>

The external process is started from a shell command given by the _command_ parameter when the first event hits the filter's input. The command can be a string or a function that returns a dynamic string.

Only _Data_ events on the filter's input are fed into the process's standard input as a byte stream. All other events are discarded. On the output of the filter, the process's standard output can be received as _Data_ events. When the process exits, a [StreamEnd](/reference/api/StreamEnd) event will be received.

When the filter is destroyed with its pipeline, the process (if any) will be killed accordingly.

## Syntax

pipy()

```
