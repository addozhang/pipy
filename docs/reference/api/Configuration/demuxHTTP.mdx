## Description

Appends a **demuxHTTP** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **demuxHTTP** filter **de-multiplexes** and decodes HTTP requests from its input [Data](/reference/api/Data) stream, distribute them to many sub-pipelines and encodes and multiplexes their HTTP responses into a single output _Data_ stream. Its input and output are _Data_ (usually TCP streams). Its sub-pipelines's input and output are HTTP [Messages](/reference/api/Message).

|          |          |             |             |                |
|---------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
|          | **Data** |             | **Message** |                |
| _Input_  | →        |             | →           |                |
|          |          | `demuxHTTP` |             | `sub-pipeline` |
| _Output_ | ←        |             | ←           |                |
|          | **Data** |             | **Message** |                |

A **demuxHTTP** filter works like this:

- At the input to a **demuxHTTP** filter, HTTP requests are **de-multiplexed** and decoded from the _Data_ stream (usually a TCP stream)
- For each request, a dedicated sub-pipeline is created, whose input will be the decoded request _Message_
- At the output from the **demuxHTTP** filter, response _Messages_ coming out of all sub-pipelines are encoded and multiplexed into one single _Data_ stream (usually a TCP stream)

One **demuxHTTP** filter can have more than one sub-pipelines, each of which handles one HTTP request.

|                 |    |             |    |                   |
|----------------:|:--:|:-----------:|:--:|:------------------|
|                 |    |             | ←→ | `sub-pipeline #1` |
| `main pipeline` | ←→ | `demuxHTTP` | ←→ | `sub-pipeline #2` |
|                 |    |             | ←→ | `sub-pipeline #N` |

Compare this to [muxHTTP()](/reference/api/Configuration/muxHTTP).

### HTTP versions

The decoder can detect the version of HTTP protocol used by the input stream and automatically switch to HTTP/2 if requested.

#### Multiplexing in HTTP/1.1

In HTTP/1.1, multiplexing is done by [HTTP pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining). A message queue is used internally inside **demuxHTTP** so that output responses from the filter will always come in the same order as the input requests, even when the sub-pipelines output their responses out of order, in which case an early-arrived response will stay in the queue waiting for its turn to come out.

#### Multiplexing in HTTP/2

In HTTP/2, multiplexing is inherently supported by the protocol itself. With HTTP/2, every _virtual stream_ in the HTTP/2 transport stream runs in a dedicated sub-pipeline. There is no shared queue to wait as in HTTP/1.1, so a delayed response from one sub-pipeline won't affect other sub-pipelines.

### Chunked transfer

When encoding an HTTP/1.x response, the [Content-Length](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length) header needs to come before the body, so **demuxHTTP** has to buffer the entire body until it sees a _MessageEnd_ event, only by then can the filter output a value for _Content-Length_ header, followed by the previously buffered body.

The buffering is limited to 4KB by default. When the buffered data is over 4KB, the encoder will opt for [chunked encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding#chunked_encoding), where a _Content-Length_ header is no longer needed. You can change this limit by the option _bufferSize_ in the _options_ parameter.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .demuxHTTP(layout)

pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .demuxHTTP(layout, {
      bufferSize,
    })
```

### Parameters

### Return value

<ReturnValue/>

## Example

``` js
pipy()

.listen(8000)                // Accept TCP connection on port 8000
  .demuxHTTP('request')      // De-multiplex and decode HTTP requests

.pipeline('request')         // Accept an individual HTTP request
  .muxHTTP('connection', '') // Encode and multiplex the request into a shared TCP stream

.pipeline('connection')      // Accept a TCP stream
  .connect('localhost:8080') // Send out to localhost:8080
```
