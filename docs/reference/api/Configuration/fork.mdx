# Description

Appends a _fork_ filter to the current pipeline layout.

A _fork_ filter creates one or more sub-pipelines, each receiving a clone of all events from the filter's input. The fork filter's output is exactly the same as its input. All output from the created sub-pipelines are discarded.

The layout based on which sub-pipelines are created is given by the first argument when you call `fork()`. The second argument is optional. It decides how many sub-pipelines are created, and what their [_contexts_](/intro/concepts#context) are.

## Create a single sub-pipeline

When you call `fork()` without a second argument, only one sub-pipeline will be created. It shares the same context as the fork filter's pipeline, aka. the _main pipeline_. That is, all states in the main pipeline is visible to the sub-pipeline, and all changes to the states in the sub-pipeline will be reflected in the main pipeline as well.

## Create multiple sub-pipelines

When you call `fork()` with a second argument, it is supposed to be an array, or a function that returns an array. The length of the array is the number of sub-pipelines to create. The elements of the array are context variable initial values for every sub-pipeline. Each sub-pipeline gets its own new context cloned from the main pipeline (the fork filter's pipeline), with some or all variables initialized with the values given in the corresponding array element.

``` js
pipy({
  _index: 0,
})

.pipeline('main')
  // Create 10 sub-pipelines based on 'sub' layout
  // They'll have number 1 to 10 for their _index values
  .fork(
    'sub',
    new Array(10).fill().map(
      (_, i) => ({
        _index: i + 1,
      })
    )
  )

.pipeline('sub')
  // Dump all events with tag _index
  .dump(
    () => _index
  )
```

# Syntax

``` js
pipy().pipeline('example').fork(layout)
pipy().pipeline('example').fork(layout, [ ...initialValueObjects ])
pipy().pipeline('example').fork(layout, () => [ ...initialValueObjects ])
```

# Example

``` js
pipy()

.listen(8000)
  // Clone all data to a sub-pipeline
  .fork('mirror')
  // Respond with 'Hello!' to all requests
  .serveHTTP(
    new Message('Hello!')
  )

.pipeline('mirror')
  // Send the cloned data to localhost:8008
  .connect('localhost:8008')
```
