title: "Configuration.pipeline()"
api: Configuration.pipeline()

# Description

Creates a sub-pipeline layout under a specified name.

Sub-pipelines are pipelines that can be created from other pipelines during the processing of a stream. They are refered to by names. Sub-pipeline names are unique within a module, but can be duplicated among different modules. Therefore, to refer to a sub-pipeline inside the current module, only the name is necessary, but to refer to a sub-pipeline in a different module (as using [`Configuration.use()`](/reference/api/Configuration/use)), the module's filename is also required.

After calling this method on a _Configuration_, the newly created pipeline layout would become current. Any _filter-creating_ methods called after this point would append filters to that pipeline, until another _pipeline-creating_ method is called.

# Syntax

``` js
pipy().pipeline(name)
```

## Parameters

<Parameters/>

## Return value

<ReturnValue/>

# Example

``` js
pipy()

// Start listening on 8080
.listen(8080)
  .fork('send-and-forget') // Clone the TCP stream to a new 'send-and-forget' sub-pipeline
  .serveHTTP(
    new Message('Hello!') // Respond with a hello
  )

// Defines a sub-pipeline layout named 'send-and-forget'
.pipeline('send-and-forget')
  .connect('localhost:8000') // Send the stream to a remote host
```
