## Description

The meta-info of a message in its tail.

### For each protocol

The content of _tail_ can vary depending on the protocol used by the message.

#### HTTP

A chunked HTTP message has an optional [trailer](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer) where extra header fields can be transfered at the end of the message. These header fields, if any, can be accessed via _headers_ property of the _tail_ object.

#### Dubbo

A Dubbo message has no meta-info in its tail, therefore the property is always null.

#### MQTT

A MQTT packet has no meta-info in its tail, therefore the property is always null.

## Syntax

``` js
messageEnd.tail
```
